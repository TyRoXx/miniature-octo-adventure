Note that the game is not playable at all on the NDS currently.

Install devkitARM as described at http://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started/devkitARM.

cd src/nds_main
make
```

There should be a *nds_main.nds* file in the current directory. You can run this executable using an NDS or an emulator.
